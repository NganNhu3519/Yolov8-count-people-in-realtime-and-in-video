In this project, I use model Yolov8n(s) to count realtime number of people entering and exiting. You can also use Yolov8 or other models of yolov8

Step 1: Make sure you put all files in the same folder
Step 2: Install Libraries: cv2, pandas, numpy, ultralytics,..
Step 3: Open Yolov8_import_video.py file or realtime, it depends on your need
Step 4: Put the correct URL of image or video in the right location
Step 5: Follow comments in the code file

*Note:
choose_are_image.py and choose_area_video.py are code to help you obtain coordinates of 2 area of your project faster
